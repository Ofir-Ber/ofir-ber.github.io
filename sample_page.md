## Hackathon - Worksite Safety Monitoring

**Project description:** Ensuring a worksite safety thanks to computer vision technology.
The client, a player in the construction industry is building a worksite monitoring solution to evaluate and mitigate risks on worksites.
• Build a worker detection model based on annotated data
• Cluster the images to process each camera independently (prerequisite to draw heatmaps)
• Build a heatmap for each worksites with density of workers during the day
• Expose your result and performance on a dashboard with a test dataset
• Identify additional value that could be brought by the detection mode

### 1. Suggest hypotheses about the causes of observed phenomena

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 2. Assess assumptions on which statistical inference will be based

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 3. Support the selection of appropriate statistical tools and techniques

### 4. Provide a basis for further data collection through surveys or experiments
